			<h1>SKILLS</h1>
			<p>Ninety miles outside Chicago Can’t stop driving I don’t know why So many questions, I need an answer Two years later you're still on my mind Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart? Who holds the stars up in the sky? Is true love just once in a lifetime? Did the captain of the Titanic cry? Oh, Someday we’ll know If love can move a mountain Someday we’ll know Why the sky is blue Someday we’ll know Why I wasn’t meant for you</p>
